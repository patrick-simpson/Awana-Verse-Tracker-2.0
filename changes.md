# Version 2.6.0 - Joyful Noise

- **Shockwave Ripple FX**: Subtle visual shockwaves blast from the number on every increment.
- **Joyful Noise Engine**: Enhanced procedural sounds (pops for every verse, triumphant chords for milestones).
- **Infinite Themes**: Added 20+ custom themes for every 50 verses up to 1000.
- **Clean UI Redesign**: Removed all theme labels and footer text post-engagement for a pure broadcast look.
- **Stabilization**: Fixed 'all black' screen issue by correcting ESM import paths and React 19 initialization.
- **Admin Visibility**: Reduced admin gear opacity to 0.05 (almost invisible) unless hovered.
